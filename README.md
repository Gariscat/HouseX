# HouseX

HouseX is a fine-grained house music dataset, including 160 tracks, that provides 4 sub-genre labels and around 17480 converted mel-spectrograms of slices of these tracks. Besides, this repository includes several baseline models for classification on these mel-spectrograms. Additionally, the start and the end of the drop of each track is annotated, as provided by the json files.

## Training
Since the computing tasks are done on the NYU HPC cluster, we need to manually load the state dictionary of the pretrained torchvision models. If you want to replicate the experiments, simply delete the line that load state dictionary in `train.py` and set `pretrained = True`. For example, if you want to use pretrained ResNet18, set `backbone = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)`.
